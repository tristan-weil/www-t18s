## Summary

I am **Tristan Weil**, I am a System Engineer and I have skills in Linux system administration and IT automation.

I currently enjoy finding solutions to ease and fasten the deployment and the maintenance of systems and applications
through automation. 

I also like participating, together with development engineers and project managers, in the entire service lifecycle of 
an application, from the design through the development stages to production maintenance.

> I am thus a supporter of the **DevOps** way of working.

I am currently looking for a job allowing me to work remotely from **Japan**. \
Contact me **tristan @ contact.t18s.fr** if you have a proposal.

Note that: \
I've started learning Japanese but the road is still long... ごめんなさい。少し日本語が話せます。\
I am currently living in France.
But thanks to my family situation, the acquisition of VISA allowing me to work is not a problem.

## Skills

I have about 10 years of experiences with **the configuration, the securing, and the maintenance** of different Linux 
distributions (Debian and CentOS) in medium-sized infrastructures (from 10 up to 400 machines/vms):

* various tasks of systems administration (from installation to production maintenance)
* deployment and configuration automation (Ansible since version 1.4)
* orchestration
* packaging

I am also able to build and maintain **key infrastructure components** that can integrate complex and critical 
architectures.
That includes:

* automated continuous integration systems (Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform)
* orchestration (Nomad, Docker Swarm)
* load balancers (HAProxy, Traefik)
* web/application servers (Apache, Nginx, Caddy)
* databases (MariaDB) and indexing services (Elasticsearch)
* monitoring / logging services (Grafana, Prometheus, collectd)

I have also some skills in:

I am currently salaried but I used to work as a contractor (I was also self-employed).
