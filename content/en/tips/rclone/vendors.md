[Rclone](https://rclone.org/) supports by default a great list of vendors, **plus** all of those offering an already 
supported API (like S3 or OpenShift).

Unfortunately some of them are not meant to be used as a backup backend as their main target is not backup 
but web development: so they are not expecting high-volume of file transfers.

So here is a list of providers I've tested :
## working {{< icon "fas fa-heart" >}}

### [OVH](https://www.ovh.com)

The good:
- file transfers are fast
- it's cheap

The bad:
- the UI is slow and crashes if you have too many files (but there is no problem if you use Rclone)

### [Wasabi](https://www.wasabi.com)

The good:
- file transfers are fast
- it's cheap

## not working for my backup use-case {{< icon "fas fa-heart-broken" >}}

With Rclone v1.52.3-339-gb6d3cad7-beta, the following providers are not working or partially working as expected.

### [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com)

The good:
- file transfers seem to work fine and fast
- the possibility to share plain files is great
- it's cheap

The bad:
- the european datacenter seems buggy: I was not able to find the API keys generated by Rclone in the user interface
- you have to use OAuth2 and to get a token you need to let your Rclone working as a working callback url: this means
that you need to open a port in your firewall

I'll try again in some months! (and you should also if you are not using the european datacenter)

### [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com)

The good:
- file transfers work fast
- it's cheap

The bad:
- unreliable transfers: sometimes slow, sometimes completely blocked (probably a rate-limit protection)

## [Mega.nz](https://www.mega.nz)

The good:
- file transfers work fast
- it's cheap
- the possibility to share plain files is great
- nice and reactive UI

The bad:
- no checksum available: Rclone is not able to cryptographically check that a file has been pushed (it fallbacks 
to the size of the file {{< icon "fas fa-bomb" >}})
